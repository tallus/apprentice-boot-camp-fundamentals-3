## Continuous Integration

Structure:

+ What is it?
+ Why is it important?
+ How do we do it?

Note: Ask people what they think it means

> “Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.  
>  
> By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.”  
> —<cite>[ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration)</cite>

--

> … integrate code into a shared repository …

Note: Integration of many developers code.  
  Shared repository meaning something like Git.  

--

> … several times a day …

Note: could be every five minutes, could be every two hours.  
  Not every three days.  

--

> … verified by an automated build …

Note: verification may mean running something, testing something, or running tools to do ‘static analysis’.  
  Automated for consistency.  
  Ideally the build process is repeatable.  

--

> … detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily …

Note: Why is it good to detect quickly?  
  Mitigate consequences, minimise context switching.  
  Spend more time building features.

## Common sense?

---

## Why is it important?

> “Works on my machine.”  
> —<cite>Unpopular developer</cite>

Note: Used to be a very common phrase.  

--

## There was a time before automated tests…

We had to wait months for things to be tested

--

## But then…

## Integrating code

+ Exposes incomplete commits & case sensitive paths
+ Makes sure code works in a (hopefully) stable environment
+ Provides early/incremental visibility of other developers changes

Note: Windows file systems case insensitive.
  Paths which won’t work on Linux/MacOS.  
  Tests which only work with developer specific incantations.  
  When working in similar areas functional changes sometimes cause conflicting changes.  
  Much easier to address conflicts while they are still small rather than spending days trying to consolidate two directions.  

--

## Build Confidence

When the build fails, you want to be confident that the code is broken

Note: Just like the boy who cried wolf…  
  If people don’t trust the build, they ignore it  

--

## Important factors

+ Time
+ Reliability
+ Meaningful failures
+ Repeatability

--

## Good practices

+ Fix broken builds quickly (don’t commit over the top)
  + Be aware of failures—use notifications etc
+ Don’t ‘commit & quit’
+ You break it, you fix it
+ Fix or delete flaky tests (don’t just re-run)
+ Make sure your build stays fast
+ Keep test environment ‘like production’

Note: Some tests are unreliable—might fail 1% of the time.  
  Fast means 5 minutes or less for some positive feedback.  
  Test environment data is rarely comparible with production.  

---

## Typical Enterprise ‘Pipeline’

* Run fast tests
* Run slow tests and static analysis
* Publish packaged code
* Deploy to dev
* Deploy to test
* Deploy to production

---

Talked about how what CI is, and why we do it.
On to the How…

--

## Many options

* Bamboo
* CircleCI
* CruiseControl.NET
* GitLab
* GoCD
* Jenkins
* TravisCI

Note: Moving landscape. GitHub should release their own version soon (Actions).  

--

## Common Features

+ GitHub Integration
+ Support for performing tasks in parallel
+ Publishing / releasing built artifacts
+ SCM support: Git / Subversion / CVS / etc.
+ Language / build tool support
+ Notifications
+ Configuration as code

---

## E.g. Travis CI

+ Authorise Travis CI to use your github.com account
+ Activate Travis CI with your repository
+ Add a `.travis.yml` file to your repository
+ Optional: add build badge to the repository

--

## Then…

+ GitHub tells Travis CI each time there is something to fetch and build
+ Travis fetches that version of the code
+ Travis works out what to run based on repository contents (including `.travis.yml`)
+ Travis reports status back to GitHub to mark commits with success/failure

--

## Configuring Travis

* Contents of `.travis.yml` tells Travis what to do
* Specific to each language… e.g.

```yaml
language: java
```

Note: Travis looks at repo to work out how to build once it knows language.  
  One line is enough to build and validate your Java.  

---

## Caution: Git

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png">

---

## Exercise prep

* Go to https://github.com/MCR-Digital/tax_calculator and fork it
* `git clone https://github.com/[YOURUSERNAME]/tax_calculator.git`
* Make sure you can run tests in your language (they are all ignored)
  * Java folk: import the `exercises/java` directory using ‘Import project from external model’
  * Choose ‘Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)’

--

## Exercise Part 1: Set up Travis CI

* Work in pairs
* Fork the example repository https://github.com/MCR-Digital/tax_calculator.git
* Log into https://travis-ci.org
* Check that you can see your repository in the list
* Activate Travis CI for your fork

Note: Make sure you have the right Travis CI  
  travis-ci.com is the paid for enterprise version  

--

## Exercise Part 2: Configure your build

* On GitHub, create `.travis.yml` at root of repo
* Hopefully see your tests pass


```yaml
language: java
before_script: "cd exercises/java"
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 35%" -->

```yaml
language: csharp
solution: exercises/dotnet/TaxCalculator.sln
before_script: "cd exercises/dotnet"
mono: none
dotnet: "2.1.502"
script: 
  - "dotnet restore"
  - "dotnet test"
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 35%" -->

```yaml
language: node_js
before_script: "cd exercises/javascript"
node_js:
  - 10
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 35%" -->

```yaml
language: python
before_script: "cd exercises/python"
python: 
  - "3.6"
script: 
  - pytest
```
<!-- .element: style="font-size: 35%" -->

Note: Remind them about the dot at the front of the filename!  

--

## Exercise Part 3: Make it fail

* Find the tests which aren't running (the ones for petrol vehicles)  
* Make the tests run (and fail)  
* Push your change  
* Watch it fail  

--

## Exercise Part 4: Make it pass

* Implement code to make the tests pass (see Story 1)
* ___***Do not change ‘DummyTaxCalculator’***___—write your own implementation (e.g. ‘DefaultTaxCalculator’)*
* Try to ___***keep your build green***___
* ___***Do not change the tests***___ (except to introduce your new calculator)
* Push your change
* Watch it pass

**\*N.B. you'll need to set the year to `2019` in your `TaxCalculator` object**

Note: Did you get an email telling you it had failed?
